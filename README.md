# DiceApp-SwiftUI
SwitUI version of the DiceApp I wrote. 
A simple app that displays two dices and randomizes its faces every time you click the "Roll" button.

## Implemented Concepts
* @State variables to handle changes
* Buttons and Stacks in SwiftUI

For the same app but built in UIKit. See the [repo here](https://github.com/R3Camarena/DiceApp)
